    "abstract": "We propose and compare two approaches to identify smart contracts as token systems by analyzing their public bytecode. The first approach symbolically executes the code in order to detect token systems by their characteristic behavior of updating internal accounts. The second approach serves as a comparison base and exploits the common interface of ERC-20, the most popular token standard. We present quantitative results for the Ethereum blockchain, and validate the effectiveness of both approaches using a set of curated token",
