    "abstract": "Human artifacts like technical papers and computer programs often carry the individual styles of their creators. If retrieved properly, such style information from the artifacts can be used to categorize the artifacts, compare the relative \"similarities\" among artifacts, and may even be used for tracing the authorship of a new artifact. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and its author (s) goes/go by the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. In this article, we use deep learning to study the styles of two Bitcoin artifacts: the first version of",
