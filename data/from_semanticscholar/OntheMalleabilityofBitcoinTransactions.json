    "abstract": "We study the problem of malleability of Bitcoin transactions. Our first two contributions can be summarized as follows:(i) we perform practical experiments on Bitcoin that show that it is very easy to maul Bitcoin transactions with high probability, and (ii) we analyze the behavior of the popular Bitcoin wallets in the situation when their transactions are mauled; we conclude that most of them are to some extend not able to handle this situation correctly. The contributions in points (i) and (ii) are experimental. We also address a more theoretical",
