    "abstract": "For many years, address clustering for the identification of entities has been the basis for a variety of graph-based investigations of the Bitcoin blockchain and its derivatives. Especially in the field of fraud detection it has proven to be useful. With the popularization and increasing use of alternative blockchains, the question arises how to recognize entities in these new systems. Currently, there are no heuristics that can directly be applied to Ethereum's account balance model. This drawback also applies to other smart contract",
