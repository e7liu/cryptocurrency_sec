**Abstract**: An algorithmic stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency managed by algorithms (ie, smart contracts) to dynamically minimize the volatility of its price relative to a specific form of asset, eg, US dollar. As algorithmic stablecoins have been growing rapidly in recent years, they become much more volatile than expected. In this paper, we took a deep dive into the core of algorithmic stablecoins and shared our answer to two fundamental research questions, ie, Are algorithmic stablecoins volatile by design? Are they volatile in practice? Specifically, we
