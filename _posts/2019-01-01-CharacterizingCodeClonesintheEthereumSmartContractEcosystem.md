**Abstract**: In this paper, we present the first large-scale and systematic study to characterize the code reuse practice in the Ethereum smart contract ecosystem. We first performed a detailed similarity comparison study on a dataset of 10 million contracts we had harvested, and then we further conducted a qualitative analysis to characterize the diversity of the ecosystem, understand the correlation between code reuse and vulnerabilities, and detect the plagiarized DApps. Our analysis revealed that over 96% of the contracts had duplicates
