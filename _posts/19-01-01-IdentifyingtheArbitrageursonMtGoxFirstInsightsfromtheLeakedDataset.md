**Abstract**: We mine the leaked history of trades on Mt. Gox, the dominant Bitcoin exchange from 2011 to early 2014, with the aim of identifying investors who performed two-point arbitrage between Mt. Gox and three other cryptocurrency exchanges (BTC-e, Bitstamp, Bitfinex). Most importantly, the availability of user identifiers per trade allows us to reconstruct the sequence of actions executed by each investor. We match these sequences to 'ideal' sequences of arbitrage trades, considering the price differences between exchanges and a user-specific estimate of transaction costs. The latter involves a fee model that is inspired by the posted fee schedules and fitted to empirical data. The subset of users whose actual series matches the ideal series best are potential arbitrageurs. Out of about 125,000 users, we identify 2,631 potential arbitrageurs with all three counterpart exchanges, and 14,291 potential arbitrageurs with at least one counterpart exchange. We consider these numbers as upper bounds and argue that post-filtering techniques are required to refine and later validate the results. A preliminary comparison of aggregate statistics between potential arbitrageurs and non-arbitrageurs is given and discussed.
