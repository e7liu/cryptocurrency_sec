**Abstract**: Several attacks have been proposed against Proof-of-Work blockchains, which may increase the attacker's share of mining rewards (eg, selfish mining, block withholding). A further impact of such attacks, which has not been considered in prior work, is that decreasing the profitability of mining for honest nodes incentivizes them to stop mining or to leave the attacked chain for a more profitable one. The departure of honest nodes exacerbates the attack and may further decrease profitability and incentivize more honest
