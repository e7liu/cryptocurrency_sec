This provides a probabilistic guarantee that transactions will not be reversed or redirected, provided that it is improbable for an attacker to obtain a majority of mining power in the network. While this may be true in the traditional sense, this assumption becomes tenuous when miners are assumed to be rational and hence venal. Accordingly, we present the whale attack, in which a minority attacker increases her chances of double-spending by
