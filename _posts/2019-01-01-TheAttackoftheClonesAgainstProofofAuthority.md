**Abstract**: In this paper, we explore vulnerabilities and countermeasures of the recently proposed blockchain consensus based on proof-of-authority. The proof-of-work blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have been shown both theoretically and empirically vulnerable to double spending attacks. This is why Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms have gained popularity in the blockchain context for their ability to tolerate a limited number t of attackers among n participants. We formalize the recently proposed proof-of-authority
